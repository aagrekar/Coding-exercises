Given a list of positive integers and an interger N, return the indices of the contiguous substring of the list whose constituents sum
closest to N. If multiple pairs of indices meet these criteria, return the one with the lowest starting index. If there are still ties,
return the one with the lowest ending index.

Return the indices as a tuple in the form (lower index, higher index). In order to return the single element, just use the elements index
twice.

For example, if you are given the list: [3,4,5,6,7] and N=14, the code should return (1,3)
